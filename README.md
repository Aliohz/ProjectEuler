# ProjectEuler

_"Project Euler is a series of challenging mathematical/computer programming problems that will require more than just mathematical insights to solve."_ [link](https://projecteuler.net/)

Here is the collection of scripts I wrote to solve some of the Project Euler problems. On each script, there is a link to the respective problem. As many of them include formulas that are hard to read in a comment.

This is a journey to become a better programmer and keep my problem solving habilities sharp.
